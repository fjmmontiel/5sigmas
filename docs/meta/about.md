# About this project

I’m {{ your short bio in 2–3 lines }}.

This site is a long-term project to document the backbone of how we got
from tally sticks and Euclidean proofs to transformers, reasoning models
and AI datacenters.

## Support and custom analysis

If you find this valuable and want to support more deep dives
(on specific models, datacenter economics, AGI timelines, etc.),
